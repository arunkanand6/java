# Operators

## Arithmetic Operators

|     |     |                |
| --- | --- | -------------- |
| +   | :   | Addition       |
| -   | :   | Substraction   |
| \*  | :   | Multiplication |
| /   | :   | Division       |
| %   | :   | Modulus        |

## Unary Operators

|     |     |                                            |
| --- | --- | ------------------------------------------ |
| -5  | :   | Unary minus                                |
| +5  | :   | Unary Plus -> Converting **'-'** into plus |
| ++i | :   | Pre-increment                              |
| i++ | :   | Post-increment                             |
| --i | :   | Pre-decrement                              |
| i-- | :   | Post-decrement                             |
| !   | :   | Logical Not operator                       |

## Assignment Operator

var = value

## Relational Operator

|     |     |                          |
| --- | --- | ------------------------ |
| ==  | :   | Equal to                 |
| !=  | :   | Not equal to             |
| <   | :   | Less than                |
| >   | :   | Greater than             |
| <=  | :   | Less than or equal to    |
| >=  | :   | Greater than or equal to |

## Logical Operators

|      |     |              |
| ---- | --- | ------------ |
| &&   | :   | Double 'and' |
| &    | :   | Single 'and' |
| \|\| | :   | Double 'or'  |
| \|   | :   | Single 'or'  |

## Ternary Operator

Condition **?** if true : if false

```
int a = 0;
boolean b = a==0?true:false
```

Here the value of **b** is set as **true** since **a==0**.

## Bitwise Operators

|     |     |                                           |
| --- | --- | ----------------------------------------- |
| &   | :   | Bitwise 'and'                             |
| \|  | :   | Bitwise 'or'                              |
| ^   | :   | Bitwise XOR                               |
| ~   | :   | Bitwise Complement Operator (bitwise not) |

## Shift Operators

|     |     |                                 |
| --- | --- | ------------------------------- |
| <<  | :   | Left Shift Operator             |
| >>  | :   | Right Shift Operator (Signed)   |
| >>> | :   | Right Shift Operator (Unsigned) |
